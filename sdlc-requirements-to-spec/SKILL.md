description: Turn the current conversation into a requirements/product spec with Gherkin scenarios and publish it to the project issue tracker or local project docs — no interview, just synthesis of what has already been discussed.
disable-model-invocation: true

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a spec (you may know this document as a PRD). Do NOT interview the user — just synthesize what you already know.

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided to you — run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` if not.

## Process

1. Explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase, if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the spec, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

2. Sketch out the seams at which you're going to test the feature. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can. The fewer seams across the codebase, the better - the ideal number is one.

Check with the user that these seams match their expectations.

3. Write the spec using the template below, then publish it to the project issue tracker. Apply the `ready-for-agent` triage label - no need for additional triage.

<spec-template>

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## Gherkin Scenarios

An extensive set of Gherkin scenarios that capture the expected behaviour of the feature.

Use `Feature`, `Scenario`, `Given`, `When`, `Then`, and `And` syntax. Prefer concrete user-observable behaviour over implementation details. Cover happy paths, edge cases, error states, permissions, data relationships, and important non-functional behaviours.

<gherkin-example>
Feature: Account balance visibility

  Scenario: Customer views account balances
    Given a mobile bank customer has signed in
    And the customer has one or more accounts
    When the customer opens the account overview
    Then the customer can see the current balance for each account
    And the customer can make better informed decisions about their spending
</gherkin-example>

The scenarios should be extensive enough to cover all important aspects of the feature.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this spec.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.
